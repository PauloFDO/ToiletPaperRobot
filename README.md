# ToiletPaperRobot

For fun during lockdown I created a robot that gives or retrieves toilet paper with voice commands (and some other speech recognition goodies), it was a fun proyect and I made a video about it, a video that you should not watch, really, it was during the lockdown, I spent 2 months all by myself, I'm sorry!
